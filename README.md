# AutoDegens

This is a Chrome extension to automate some ui interactions
in [Degens Idle](https://www.degensidle.com)

## Building

- clone
- `npm i`
- `npm run build`
- load the resulting `dist` directory into Chrome as an
  unpacked extension
- subsequent builds can just hit the refresh button in
  Chrome after building instead of re-loading the directory
